Gotta leave this heat island
To a little plot in the hills
A patio draped in serape
First cool day in a year
Drinking up the time and thinking
What ever happened to utopian dreams?
Without you I'd feel so lonely
On a rock consumed in steam
It's time
For moving on
To high
Ground we're on

I need you, darling you

Don't really need the city
Sunset on the violet crown
Don't really want the money
All the heat just pushing us out
I'll be fine just us
I'll be fine just us

I need you, darling you

Keep climbing
Waters rising
It's getting hotter
Take this farther
I just need you
I need you, darling you
