A bit too young, a touch too numb
Coming up for air
With ten wars at once on the news at five,
You'd do anything to feel alive

And you're smiling...

Darling you, you've got to know
That I'm onto you, and
I want to feel my body on top of you
And get used, if only for
The view from above.

You're stupid high, in the back of my
Idling, sidetracked mind.
Chewing foil between your teeth,
Skipping school to screw in your backseat

Girl that prayer won't get you much
But on your knees to feel the touch

Darling you, you've got to know
That I lied to you
When I said someday I could die for you
When we knew that we'd both
Die for anything.

She said,
"Johnny come lately,
You can't save me."

So, who can save your bad behavior?
Who can save our bad behavior?

Darling you, you've got to know that I lied to you
When I said someday I would die for you
When we knew that we'd both
Die for anything.
