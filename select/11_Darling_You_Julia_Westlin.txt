Love be mine
I know it's hard to find
It is a long long ride
Ocean between our lands

Trust in you
I know our love is true
They say I'm crazy too
But darling I am for you

Babe I'm going crazy
Without you
By my side

Love
Love makes you want
More than you got
I'll give you all that I have

Yours to hold
Darling now I'll be strong
Enter the world unknown
I'm not afraid to go

Darling you
All of my dreams come true
I'll cross that ocean too
I'd do it all for You

Babe I'm going crazy
Without you
By my side

Love
Love makes you want
More than you got
I'll give you all that I have

Love
Love makes you strong
More than you thought
I'll give it all to
My darling, you
