Darlin', darlin' you know I love you
I love you for myself
But you're gone, gone and left me for someone else

I think of you, think of you every morning
I dream of you every night
And would love, love to be with you always

When night began to fall
I cry, cry alone
And I wish, baby I could hold you in my arms tonight

Oh darlin', darlin' you know I love you
I love you, for myself
But you're gone, gone and left me for someone else
